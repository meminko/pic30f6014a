**Step 1:**\
Install the setup file for your operating system from the zip file named
mikroprog-pic-dspic-pic32-drivers.

**Step 2:**\
Install the setup file from the zip file named
mikroprog-suite-pic-dspic-pic32-programming-software-setup-v290.

**Step 3:**\
The program should be opened **without** the microcontroller being
inserted. (On some computers, if it is inserted before opening the
program, an error may occur.)

**Step 4:**\
As shown in the photo, click on the **Load** button to load the .hex
