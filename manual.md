<p>mikroBoard for dsPIC 80-pin™ Manual</p>
<p><em>All MikroElektronika´s development systems represent
irreplaceable tools for programming and developing microcontroller-based
devices. Carefully chosen components and the use of machines of the last
generation for mounting and testing thereof are the best guarantee of
high reliability of our devices. Due to simple design, a large number of
add-on modules and ready to use examples, all our users, regardless of
their experience, have the possibility to develop their projects in a
fast and efficient way.</em></p>
<p>Development System</p>
<p><strong>mikroBoard for dsPIC 80-pin</strong></p>
<p>The mikroBoard is miniature development tool which includes
microcontroller, programer, small proto board and two 2x40 female
headers for connection with UNI-DS6 development system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Main purpose of the mikroBoard is usage as MCU card for UNI-DS6
development system. For connection with the UNI- DS6 mikroBoard use two
2x40 female headers. Integrated part of mikroBoard is programmer which
is used for MCU programming. To connect on-board programmer with a PC
mikroBoard use USB cable.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="mikroboard-as-standalone-device">mikroBoard as standalone
device:</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>To use mikroBoard as standalone device it is necessary to place
jumper J1 (STANDALONE). For power supply in standalone mode mikroBoard
can use USB power supply from PC via connector CN3 or via 2x40 female
header. When power supply is connected via 2x40 female header it is
necessary to provide regulated 5V power supply.</p>

<p>For programming purposes it is necessary to install adequate software
on your PC. mikroBoard for dsPIC 80-pin use mikroProg Suite for PIC
programmer software which can be downloaded from: <a
